The Fragforce Elder Council took over large sections of the Salesforce office
in Herndon, VA on April 1st-2nd 2016 in order to play games, and help to save
kids at the same time. We partnered with [Extra Life][EL] in order to pledge 
our time spent marathoning games, and to petition others to help us raise 
money at the same time in order to support [Children's Miracle Network][CMN].

I personally, as the captain of the [Fragforce][FF] team, was excited to be
able to take this time out of my workday, and to bring this amazing project
to more people at my office, and in my personal life at the same time. We were
streaming the event live to [Twitch][FF-Twitch], and I was able to utilize
donated gear, as well as gear provided by my budgetary requests to facilitate
this, and after learning more about how to do these things better, feel that 
we are much more able to broadcast these sorts of things in the future.

My favorite event that we were able to pull off during this event would have
to be the time that we managed to get 4 kids, aged 11 and below together in
the same room, playing [Minecraft][MC] together. We had all 4 laptops that they
were playing on streaming via RTMP to a local 1U server that we had loaned to
us for the event by the Bootstrap team at Salesforce. Our streaming setup was
able to pull all 4 of those streams together, along with a room camera and
microphone setup, and record all 4 kids playing together in harmonic chaos.

Leading up to this event, and through this event, we were able to raise over
$16,000 dollars for our [Extra-Life Team][FF-EL], and to contribute almost
1,000 volunteer hours for our office! You can even see the back of my head in
the broadcast booth picture below :-D
