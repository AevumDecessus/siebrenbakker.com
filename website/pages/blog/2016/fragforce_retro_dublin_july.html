The Fragforce Elder Council was able to create and run the first ever 
international [Fragforce][FF] event in the Dublin, Ireland Atriumoffice this 
past weekend (July 22-23, 2016). We took over the 2 largest rooms in the Atrium
and were able to spend 24 hours playing pc, console, board, and viretual reality
games, all while simultaneously raising money for [Child's Play Charity][CPC]

As of this writing, we have been able to raise over $2,300 directly for [Child's
Play][CPC], before any matching funds from the [Salesforce Foundation][SFF]!

We rented 20 gaming computers from [Multiplay][MP], which was an amazing help 
for employees who either didn't have a gaming computer, or were not able to
easily transport said computers, as most employees utilise public 
transportation. After some small hiccups with transportation (out of Multiplay's
control, we received the machines the day before the event, and were able to 
enjoy their use greatly. We are definitely considering their use again for the
next major Dublin event planned for November.

I was able to travel to the Dublin office in support of this event, something
that I am very excited to have been able to do, as it was also my first time 
ever traveling to Ireland. I spent 10 days in the country along with my wife,
as well as enjoyed my time helping set up, and participate in, this Fragforce
adventure in a new country.
