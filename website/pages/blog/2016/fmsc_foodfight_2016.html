I was able to volunteer with [FMSC][FMSC] over the weekend for their 
[Foodfight 2016][FF] mobile pack event at the Dulles Expo Center in Centreville
over the weekend. I was able to work as part of the warehouse crew, working on 
wrapping and strapping pallets the first shift, and running boxes/ingredients 
for the second shift, both of which were demanding in different ways.

It was very enjoyable to be able to work with the [FMSC][FMSC] staff again,
now that I no longer live within easy range of one of their permanent sites. We
were able to spend a little bit of time with some of the staff members that we 
knew from the permanent site that we used to volunteer at weekly.
